# Stata new commandï¼šlpoly1--act as lpoly, but more coefficients can be additionally obtained

This file was left on purpose for future editing.

If the number of observations in variable **X_grid** is small, the running time of commands `lpoly1` and `lpoly` will not differ too much, but if the number of observations in variable **X_grid** is large, the official command `lpoly` will be much faster than command `lpoly1` written by myself.

For the help of command `lpoly1`, please `help lpoly1` in Stata after `wmt install lpoly1`.

Please refer to [this page](https://github.com/Meiting-Wang/wmt) for the installation of `wmt` command.
